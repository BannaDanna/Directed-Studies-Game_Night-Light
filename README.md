# Directed-Studies-Game_Night-Light

This is my Computer Science directed studies project. I am unsure if I will publish this demo to the public or not. However, if I do, this has been created to inform people that bother to read the README files.

This game is about a female protaganist named Gabi Delos Luzes. She is interrupted in the middle of the night and explores the house to investigate. Armed with a strange flashlight, Gabi discovers that she is not alone in the house, and it ain't her parents...

Keep in mind that this is a demo created by a 10th grade first time indie game developer and may have a few glitches and bugs that could not have been detected.
Please do not steal my ideas in terms of characters and story, however, spin offs and fan stories are acceptable and encouraged.
